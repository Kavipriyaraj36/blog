        <h2 class="post-title">My Online Quiz App — A Smart Learning Experience</h2>

        <p class="post-content">
            Creating this <strong>Android Online Quiz App</strong> was one of the 
            most exciting projects in my journey as a developer.  
            I wanted to build something simple, fast, and truly helpful for students  
            who want to test themselves anytime with a fun and interactive interface.
        </p>

        <p class="post-content">
            The app opens with a <strong>clean and minimal home screen</strong> that contains  
            a “Start Quiz” button. The moment the user clicks it, the quiz begins with  
            a smooth transition into a beautifully designed question screen.
        </p>

        <p class="post-content">
            Each question appears with four options arranged neatly on the screen.  
            The highlight is the <strong>30-second countdown timer</strong> that adds excitement  
            and pushes the user to think quickly. If the chosen answer is correct,  
            the score automatically increases — all in real time,  
            without navigating to another page.
        </p>

        <p class="post-content">
            What makes the app special is its simplicity:  
            clean UI, instant score updates, smooth navigation, and a responsive layout  
            make it enjoyable for users of any age.  
            This project helped me learn a lot about activity navigation, UI layouts,  
            and improving overall user experience.
